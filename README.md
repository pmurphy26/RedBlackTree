Project Description
-----------------
This is a project that I created for my post AP Data Structures and Algorithms class as a senior in high school.
We spent some time learning about binary trees and implementing the code for them and then specifically red and 
black trees without the code before implementing it into code.
The program's main class prints out a randomly made tree of 10 nodes, the nodes are printed in the following format:
data (Color, leftnode, rightnode)
